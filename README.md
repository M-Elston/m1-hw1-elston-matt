## <font color="#7575FF">About Me</font> ##
While some of the HTML codes/tags are coming back to me after so many years, this Markdown language is alien. How do I decrease the size of the above image? In HTML, I'd add the height and weight values to the image tag, but doing so to the Markdown tag doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong?
## <font color="#7575FF">Past Coding Experience</font> ##
Minimal. Taught myself basic HTML as a hobby back in the late 90's or early 2000's - I forget which - when Midi's were still a thing. Haven't touched it since to pursue other goals.
